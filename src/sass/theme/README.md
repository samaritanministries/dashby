#Themes

## Include your override theme file

Import your theme file to your main application folder (you will need to create this yourself). When you're all finished, it should be structured like this:

```scss
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/vendor/normalize";
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/base/base";
@import "theme/theme";
@import "/bower_components/dashing/sass/modules/modules";
```
